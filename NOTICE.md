Original item text and response observations are distinct rights-bearing material. Preserve source records; avoid additional publication of instrument wording in examples, wheels or derived outputs. Citation/deposit metadata describes these scopes; it does not establish a Zenodo deposit or DOI.

## Historical documents

The seven original PDFs remain unchanged in [docs/reviews](docs/reviews/). They are historical reviews/protocol drafts, not current software contracts or validation results. Corrections below were checked against primary documentation on 6–7 October 2026.

| Source document | Correction |
|---|---|
| [Threshold](<docs/reviews/Threshold.pdf>) | Fixation, HRV, SCR and facial-movement proposals lack anxiety-classifier validation. Later README additions of 500 deg/s and 3.0/FACS C were absent from the original threshold table. |
| [Sensor Documentation](<docs/reviews/Sensor Documentation.pdf>) | HW401/E4/AXIS specifications and FaceReader method/accuracy need the model-specific corrections below. The added protocol phases total 35 min, not 30. |
| [Sensors overview](<docs/reviews/Sensors (Eye-tracking, HRV, GSR, Camera).pdf>) | HW401 is optical PPG; separate world video from eye sampling. Reviewed hardware does not establish CSV channel provenance. |
| [OpenFace vs Noldus](<docs/reviews/OpenFace vs Noldus.pdf>) | AU output and expression benchmarks are version-specific. Support speed and superiority were not measured. |
| [Sensor Comparison](<docs/reviews/Sensor Comparison.pdf>) | Compare matching models/modalities; categorical rate/reliability claims are unsupported. Prose/bibliography years conflict: Alrefaei 2019/2023, Gualniera 2019/2021, Rosler 2021/2020. The Erdi autobiographical thesis does not establish hardware reliability. Unlinked ANOVA and “To do” material are draft content. |
| [Experiment Scenario](<docs/reviews/Experiment Scenario.pdf>) | 10 min interview + 5 min setup + 15 min testing totals 30 min before baseline/debrief. The shipped raw recording spans about 535 s. |
| [List of Sensors](<docs/reviews/List of Sensors.pdf>) | Earlier list has 10 devices; consolidated review has 11, including HW401. Review coverage is separate from acquired channels. |

## Supported corrections

| Topic | Primary-source correction |
|---|---|
| HW401 | Optical PPG armband, rechargeable battery rated 25+ h. Historical ECG, CR2032/800 h, processor and R-R capability claims are unsupported. [Moofit](https://moo.fit/products/moofit-heart-rate-monitor-armband) |
| OpenFace | Supports AU23 lip tightening; AU24 lip pressing is absent from its output list. Intensity output spans 0–5; it supplies no validated anxiety cutoff. [AUs](https://github.com/TadasBaltrusaitis/OpenFace/wiki/Action-Units), [FACS names](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~face/facs.htm) |
| E4 | Original retired E4: manufacturer comparison lists battery life up to 36 h. Historical 48/60 h claims are unsupported here. [Empatica](https://www.empatica.com/research/e4/) |
| AXIS P1275 | Original model: 1920×1080, maximum 25/30 fps, not 60 fps. [Model support](https://www.axis.com/en-gb/products/axis-p1275/support) |
| Pupil Core / SMI | World-camera frames and eye/gaze sampling are different quantities. Rates depend on model/configuration; no catalog option identifies the acquired CSV configuration. Generic SMI “60 Hz” needs a model qualifier. [Pupil documentation](https://docs.pupil-labs.com/core/getting-started/) |
| FaceReader | Version 10 describes deep-network face modeling; six basic expressions plus neutral. Manufacturer ADFES/WSEFEP expression accuracy: FR10 98.7%/97.2%; FR9 99.3%/95.7%. These do not measure anxiety detection in this sample.

## Measurement limits

- Literature on [pupillometry](https://doi.org/10.1177/1745691611427305), [arousal and saccades](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neubiorev.2013.03.011), [task-specific velocity thresholds](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21287116/) and [HRV measurement](https://doi.org/10.1161/01.CIR.93.5.1043) does not validate the old anxiety rules on this one-person sample.
- Anonymous channel mapping, calibration, summary aggregation/baselines/blink rules and cross-stream clock synchronization are unestablished. Stored item codes have no verified reverse-keying/aggregate-score provenance.
- Current analysis describes observations and legacy low-movement runs. Repeated interval samples do not establish beat HRV; response times and supplied flags do not establish psychological states.
