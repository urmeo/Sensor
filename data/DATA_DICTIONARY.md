# Data dictionary

**Signals · Clocks · Units · Provenance**

One participant. Raw sensors and questionnaire responses cover Session 1; supplied eye summaries cover three sessions. [Schema](../datapackage.json) defines stored types and constraints. [Rights and corrections](../NOTICE.md) apply to every resource.

| Resource | Rows | Scope |
|---|---:|---|
| `hr.csv` | 4,032 | Sampled heart-rate readings |
| `ibi.csv` | 2,394 | Quantized interval readings |
| `sed.csv` | 34,171 | Eye-tracking export |
| `sed_fix.csv` | 34,171 | Original eye columns plus legacy segmentation |
| `eye_metrics.csv` | 264 | 88 question summaries × 3 sessions |
| `Psychometric_Test_Results.csv` | 88 | Session 1 item responses |

`sed.csv → legacy gaze runs → descriptive plots`

## Clocks

| Resource | Calendar fields | Source zone | Relative-copy origin |
|---|---|---|---|
| `hr`, `ibi`, `sed`, `sed_fix` | `datetime` | Naive; unspecified | Retain existing recording-relative `reltime` |
| `eye_metrics` | `Start Time`, `End Time` | Naive; unspecified | Earliest start within each `Test` |
| `psych` | `Question Start Time`, `Question Answer Time` | Aware; UTC | Earliest questionnaire start |

- Source streams span about 535 seconds. Shared clock readings do not establish synchronization; timezone and acquisition clock mapping are missing.
- The schema's `timeZone`, `timestampAwareness`, `timestampFields` and `relativeTimeOrigin` are custom descriptive metadata. Each resource is checked independently.
- Relative copies remove calendar columns and retain sensitive responses and physiological patterns. See [data ethics](../DATA_ETHICS.md).

## Heart rate and interval readings

| File | Column | Type | Stored range / meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| Both | `reltime` | number | 0.001–534.892 s from recording start |
| Both | `datetime` | string | Naive `YYYY/MM/DD HH:MM:SS.fff`; zone unspecified |
| Both | `iSensor` | integer | Anonymous channel 0–5; device mapping unavailable |
| `hr` | `confidence` | number | 0 or 1; `valid_hr` retains 1 |
| `hr` | `heart_rate` | number | 0–73 BPM; zero represents no lock in supplied metadata |
| `ibi` | `ibi` | integer | 0–1,093 ms; zero initialization values retained |

| Channel observation | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 3 and 5 | Active HR/interval channels; hardware identities unrecorded |
| 0, 1, 2, 4 | Initialization rows without valid HR signal |
| Interval counts | Channel 5: 1,809; channel 3: 581; four initialization rows |

Repeated/quantized interval readings are not a verified NN or R-R beat sequence. Reliable RMSSD/SDNN cannot be inferred from these samples. Reviewed Polar/Moofit devices do not establish channel identities; HW401 is optical PPG.

## Eye stream: `sed.csv`

The historical filename means “Smart Eye Data”. Recorded device, adapter, sampling configuration, coordinate units and calibration are undocumented.

| Column | Type | Stored range / meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `reltime` | number | 0.001–534.979 s from recording start |
| `datetime` | string | Naive calendar clock; zone unspecified |
| `iSensor` | integer | 0 |
| `headPos.x`, `headPos.y`, `headPos.z` | number | All zero; coordinate units unknown |
| `headPosQ` | number | All zero |
| `headYaw`, `headPitch`, `headRoll` | number | All zero; angle units unknown |
| `headRotQ` | number | All zero |
| `gazeSrc.x`, `gazeSrc.y`, `gazeSrc.z` | number | Approximately −0.02 to 0.01; coordinate units unknown |
| `gazeDir.x`, `gazeDir.y`, `gazeDir.z` | number | Reported gaze-direction components, approximately −0.3 to 1 |
| `gazeQ` | number | Reported tracking quality, 0.11–1 |
| `leftEyeOpen`, `rightEyeOpen` | number | Reported openness scale, 0–10 |
| `leftEyeOpenQ`, `rightEyeOpenQ` | number | Reported quality, 0–1 |
| `pupil` | number | 0–3.88; reported mm, calibration unavailable |
| `pupilQ` | number | Reported measurement quality, 0–1 |

All-zero head fields have an unknown acquisition cause. `valid_pupil` keeps finite, positive pupil readings and finite quality values with `0.5 < pupilQ <= 1` by default. Its configurable cutoff must be finite and within 0–1. This is a descriptive filter, not a validated anxiety rule.

## Legacy runs: `sed_fix.csv`

All 24 source columns are retained.

| Added column | Type | Definition |
|---|---|---|
| `gaze_diff` | number | Euclidean displacement between consecutive direction vectors; first row null; dimensionless |
| `fixation` | boolean | `gaze_diff < 0.01`; first row false |
| `fixation_id` | integer | 1-based ID for every contiguous true **or** false run |
| `duration` | number | Last-minus-first `reltime` in a true run, repeated on its rows; null for false runs |

- Existing observations: 30,289 true samples; 2,479 true runs; 4,958 total runs; true-run spans 0–1.938 s.
- This low-movement heuristic has no quality, gap or minimum-duration rule. False samples are not measured saccades.
- Reproduction compares derived numbers with `rtol=0`, `atol=1e-9`. The source CSV remains unchanged.

## Supplied summaries: `eye_metrics.csv`

Previously named `HRV.csv`; these are eye summaries. Aggregation code, baseline intervals, blink-event rules and calibrated pupil scale are unavailable.

| Column | Type | Supplied meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `Test` | string | `Test 01`, `Test 02`, `Test 03` |
| `Type` | string | `HADS`, `STAI-S`, `STAI-T`, `BFI`, `FQ` |
| `Start Time`, `End Time` | string | Supplied question boundaries; naive clock |
| `Score` | integer | Stored item code, 0–6 |
| `Average Pupil Dilation` | number | 1.22–3.13; reported mm; diameter versus baseline change unverified |
| `Average Left Blink Rate` | number | 0–254.05; reported blinks/min |
| `Average Right Blink Rate` | number | 0–458.43; reported blinks/min |
| `Pupil Dilation Increase` | string | Supplied `Yes`/`No` flag |
| `Left Blink Rate Increase`, `Right Blink Rate Increase` | string | Supplied `Yes`/`No` flags |

Session 1 has 88 “Yes” pupil flags. Their cause is unknown. Large blink values and all flags remain as supplied; no clinical threshold or silent cleaning is applied. Raw Sessions 2–3 are unavailable, and clock correspondence alone does not reproduce summaries.

## Responses: `Psychometric_Test_Results.csv`

| Column | Type | Stored meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `Test` | string | HADS 14; STAI-S 20; STAI-T 20; BFI 10; FQ 24 rows |
| `Question` | string | Original instrument wording; third-party rights |
| `Answer` | string | Selected wording; third-party answer-option rights remain |
| `Score` | integer | Stored item code, 1–6; keyed scoring unestablished |
| `Time(s)` | number | Response duration, 2.016–22.737 s |
| `Question Start Time`, `Question Answer Time` | string | ISO timestamps with UTC offset |

Variant, reverse-keying and aggregate-score provenance are missing. These codes are not validated scale totals. Time fields are checked against `Time(s)` within 0.001 s; longer responses do not establish deliberation, avoidance or anxiety.
